# esn-vs-lstm-on-cross-situationnal-learning


#### Context of creation
This repository compile the work I did during an internship in 2020 in the Mnemosyne Team (Inria Bordeaux) with Xavier Hinaut.

## Content

This work includes: 
* A comparison between Long-Short Term Memory networks (LSTM) and Echo States Networks (ESN) on a Cross-Situationnal Learning task (CSL).
* Visualisation of activity of LSTM cells and ESN reservoir units.
* Visualisation by means of dimensionnal reduction technique UMAP of the structure of recurrent states space for both LSTM and ESN.
